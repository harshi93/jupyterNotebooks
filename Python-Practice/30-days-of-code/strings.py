"""
strings are ordered sequences

hence we can use indexing and slicing to grab specific sequences

you can also perform reverse indexing on string

slicing allows you to grab sub-section of string

it has syntax [start:stop:step]

stop is an index you go upto but not include element at that index


[:2] - means start from 0 go uptil 2
[2:] - means start from 2 and go until last
[::1] - read the whole string while skipping 1 character
[::-1] - read the whole string in reverse fashion while skipping 1
character

you can't do character re-assignment in string

variable_name * 10 = that many variables

x.split() - splits string based on whitespace by default
x.split('i') - splits string on i
